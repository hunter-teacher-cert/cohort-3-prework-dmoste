Exercise 1
Logical operators can simplify nested conditional statements. For example, can you rewrite this code using a single if statement?


if (x > 0 && x < 10) {
  System.out.println("positive single digit number.");
}

Exercise 2
1. Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the second time zoop is invoked.

main: zoop("just for", 5)
zoop: System.out.println("just for")
zoop: ping("not ")
ping: System.out.println("any " + "not " + "more ")
main: clink(4)
clink: System.out.print("It's ")
clink: zoop("breakfast ", 4)
zoop: System.out.println("breakfast ")
zoop: System.out.println("!")

2. What is the complete output?

just for
any not more
It's breakfast
!

Exercise 3
Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program in Section 5.8 after main invokes nLines with the parameter n == 4, just before the last invocation of nLines returns.

main: nLines()
nLines: nLines(0)
