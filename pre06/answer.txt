Exercise 1
1. Draw a table that shows the value of the variables i and n during the execution of loop. The table should contain one column for each variable and one line for each iteration.

iter    i      n
0       10    10
1        5    10
2        6    10
3        3    10
4        4    10
5        2    10
6        1    10

2. What is the output of this program?
10
5
6
3
4
2

3. Can you prove that this loop terminates for any positive value of n?
If the value is positive it will cut in half. If still positive, it will cut in half again. This process continues until the value is 1 and the program ends. This terminates by definition.

If the value is odd, it will become positive by adding one and will then be cut in half.
